    <h2>Hiding in the Shadows</h2>
    <p>For a long time, I lived life on autopilot - moving through each day by following what I was taught, believing what I was told, and trying to fit into roles and expectations that simply were never made for me. I measured my worth by how others saw me - their opinions, comparisons, and expectations (I’m sure a lot of us brown girls can relate to this).</p>
      <p>Growing up, I was constantly compared to my sister, whether at home or school or even at mundane places like salons, and slowly over time, I internalised the belief that I simply wasn’t enough. That belief settled quietly but deeply, shaping years filled with self-doubt, where I questioned my voice, my decisions, and even the core of who I was.</p>
      <p>It was a heavy weight to carry, and for many years, I felt trapped by it - a kind of learned helplessness where trying felt pointless because I thought my efforts wouldn’t change anything. <br> But life has a way of surprising us...</p>

      <h2>The Moment Someone Truly Saw Me</h2>
      <p>Everything began to shift when I met someone who saw me - not through the usual filters of comparison and expectation, but truly and kindly. <br> My partner believed in me in a way that made me want to believe in myself again.</p>
      <p>For the first time, I had the space and safety to ask: <em>Who am I - beyond all these roles I’ve been given? What do I want my life to look like?</em> <br> These questions were new and daunting, but also full of possibility.</p>

      <h2>The Beginning of Questioning Everything I Was Taught</h2>
      <p>One day, I randomly came across footage from a slaughterhouse - and I froze. The footage shook something deep inside me. For the first time, I really questioned the things I had accepted without question, the traditions and beliefs that had shaped my world.</p>
      <p>It was painful to face, but also liberating. I realised I could no longer support such cruelty towards animals and that I should align my actions with my values. And so I made the decision to go vegan - not because of health or trends, but because I no longer wanted to be part of the harm.</p>
      <p>It was a conscious decision to take responsibility for the impact of my choices and to live with more awareness - to ask not <em>What should I do?</em> but <em>What feels right? Is there a kinder, more conscious way to live?</em> </p>

       <h2>The Break That Set Me Free</h2>
       <p>In 2019, I moved to Australia to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in IT. Back in Sri Lanka, netball had been a big part of my life for nearly ten years. After stepping away from it for three years, I missed the game and the joy it brought me. So, I joined my university’s indoor netball team, feeling like I was reconnecting with a part of myself I’d lost touch with.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't long before everything changed forever... <br> During a final match, I had a freak accident and I fractured my femur. It was a sudden, random injury - completely unrelated to my strength or health. Several medical scans later confirmed that my bone density was well above average (BMD: 1.3 g/cm³). So I guess I was just not meant to take home a gold medal that night :/</p>
      <p>Around that time, I had just begun to truly explore who I was. Leaving Sri Lanka gave me a sense of freedom I never had before - for the first time, I wasn’t just someone’s sister. I was just ... <i>me</i>. <br> I also started learning how to care for my natural curly hair (something I was taught to despise growing up) and I began to embrace my brown skin, which I had also been conditioned to see as less-than. And ironically, it was this fracture - this painful, unexpected moment - that brought me even closer to my true self.</p>
      <p>Instead of breaking me, it woke me up. It empowered me. <br> After years of being told to follow someone else’s footsteps, I was finally walking my own path - even if I had to limp for a while to get there.</p>

      <h2>The Sound of Coming Home</h2>
      <p>Though the injury was painful, it forced me to slow down in a way I never had before. In that stillness, I found my way back to music - not the structured, theory-heavy way I had been taught, but the way I played as a child: by ear and from feeling.</p>
      <p>This raw, emotional reconnection led to my debut piano composition, <a href="music.html" class="custom-link"><em>Featherfall</em></a> - a piece born from healing and rebirth.</p>
      <p>As I moved through rehab, I also discovered something else: the deep, incredible strength of both the body and the mind. Even being bedridden for a week made me realise how precious the gift of movement is - a gift so often taken for granted.That experience has shaped my mindset to this day. <br> I no longer train to chase extremes or prove anything - I train with intention, awareness, and gratitude for what my body can do. Every rep, every stretch, every breath now feels like a way of honouring that gift.</p>

      <h2 class="jana-title">Why I Created <em>Just Jana</em></h2><br>
      <p><em>Just Jana</em> was born from this whole journey - from breaking down and rebuilding, from unlearning and reconditioning, from doubt to identity.</p>
      <p>It’s a sacred space to come home to yourself. A reminder that you are enough - not once you’ve changed, but as you are.</p>
      <p>Reclaiming myself has been the most life-changing thing I’ve ever done. I know what it’s like to live in learned helplessness. I know what it’s like to feel invisible. I didn’t have the space to uncover who I really am, and so now I’ve created one for us - a space to feel seen, safe, and enough.</p>
      <p>I want you to feel the empowerment that comes from reclaiming your story. I want you to experience what it means to truly love and embrace your authentic self - not the version others expect, but the one you know deep down you were always meant to be.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Just Jana</em></strong> is not about changing who you are - it’s about peeling back the layers, healing through what speaks to you, and coming home to yourself. Whether it’s through fitness, music, or simply living with more awareness - there’s something here for everyone.</p>
      <p class="closing-line">This is not just my story - it’s a mirror for anyone who’s ever felt like they were too much, not enough, or lost in someone else’s shadow. <br> If any part of this story resonates with you… welcome. You’re not alone - and you’re exactly where you need to be! ♡</p>
