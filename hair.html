          There was a time when I couldn’t stand what I saw in the mirror. I hated my curls so much that I’d try to rip them out of my scalp. I brushed them aggressively, tugged until it hurt, and even lay on the couch during dinner with my head pressed into the cushions, hoping the weight of my body would flatten them. 
          I even tried Jedi mind tricks - imagining my DNA strands and “mentally straightening” them, as if I could somehow rewire my genetics.
          <br><br> Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.

        <div class="story-block">

            <h2>Where the Story Really Began</h2>
            <p>It wasn’t truly my hair I was fighting - it was the societal conditioning I’d absorbed about what was “beautiful” and “acceptable.”</p>
            <p>Some of those messages came from the world around me. Some, heartbreakingly, came from within my own home.</p>
            <p>One of my earliest memories are of being told that I look like a Sri Lankan male actor (Vijaya Kumaratunga) - meant as a light-hearted joke, but to me, it stung and left a mark to this day. I began to wish for different hair, slowly believing I needed it to be accepted.</p>
            <p>Then there were the mornings before school when I was younger - rushed and chaotic. On difficult days, my hair was combed in frustration and if my hair didn’t cooperate, the brush was left dangling from my head for me to “deal with.” Somewhere along the line, I started to believe I was “too hard to look after.”</p>
            <p> Both of my parents have curls too, but I inherited not just their hair type - I inherited their unhealed relationship with their own hair. Growing up, I’d watch my mum spend a lot of time and money on keratin treatments, learning silently that curly hair was something to be “fixed.” I was told I was too young to have those treatments, but I was eagerly looking forward to the day I could.</p>

            <h2>The Deep Cuts of Comparison</h2>
            <p>I was the only curly-haired child in my family. My siblings’ smoother hair seemed easier to manage, and they fit in effortlessly, while I felt like the odd one out.</p>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, salons wouldn’t just cut your hair - they’d blow-dry it straight if you have natural curls, as though doing you a favour. My mum would specifically request stylists to reduce my hair volume, using phrases like she has <em>yaksha konde</em> - “devil hair.” My sister’s hair, on the other hand, was always admired.</p>
            <p>At special occasions, I’d sit in a salon chair, waiting for the magical transformation. Once my hair was sleek and straight, I felt “presentable”. I’d delay washing it, holding onto that version of myself for as long as possible. At school, those days were met with “Wow! Good hair day!” - and although I smiled, it hurt to know that version of me wasn’t my true self.</p>

          <div class="story-text">
            <h2>When Curls Became the Villain</h2>
            <p>Even the media seemed to whisper the same message - sometimes loudly, sometimes so subtly you almost missed it. In Sri Lanka, shampoo ads would feature white women with pin-straight hair, women who looked nothing like anyone I knew. On screen, the “beautiful” heroines so often shared the same template - in <em>Tangled</em>, the radiant main character had long, straight blonde hair, while the villain was given dark, curly locks.</p>
            <p>It didn’t stop there. <em>The Princess Diaries</em> makeover scene was designed to show the audience that curly hair represented the “before,” while straight hair symbolised the “after.” By doing so, it framed the natural, curly-haired version of a girl as something messy or flawed - a problem that needed fixing. In <em>Harry Potter</em>, Bellatrix Lestrange’s chaotic curls were used as a visual cue for madness. Over and over again, curls became shorthand for “messy,” “unruly,” “untrustworthy.”</p>
            <p>The only time I can remember curls being shown as something beautiful was in <em>Brave</em> (2012) - and even then, they belonged to a fair-skinned, red-haired character. Never dark skin. Never dark hair. Never someone who looked like me, or like so many other South Asian girls.</p>
            <p>I can count on one hand the times I saw curls celebrated - not as a punchline, not as a villain’s mark, but as something powerful, heroic, and worthy. That absence left an imprint on me… and I know it’s one many other curly-haired girls have carried too.</p>

            <p>Then I met my boyfriend.</p>
            <p>One of the very first things he ever said to me - long before we started dating - was that he loved my natural hair and preferred it over when I straightened it. I honestly thought he was being sarcastic. I’d never been complimented on my curls before, so I couldn’t believe him.</p>
            <p>Once, while we were talking about movies, he even mentioned that he actually liked Mother Gothel’s hair in <em>Tangled</em> more than Rapunzel’s. To me, that sounded absurd - she was the villain, and her curls were part of the “messy and untrustworthy” image I had been conditioned to dislike. I was so deeply wired to see straight hair as beautiful that I assumed he was being sarcastic.</p>
            <p>And truthfully… I didn’t believe him. Not for years. But over time, his love for the things I tried to hide started rubbing off on me. Everything I was insecure about… he celebrated. He helped me see that what I thought made me less, made me me.</p>

            <p>One night, I went to bed with wet hair and woke up to defined curl clumps. I decided not to brush them out - just for once - because I felt like they looked good. That tiny decision felt like a breakthrough. For a while, I thought I was a genius: “Just sleep with wet hair, that’s the trick!”</p>
            <p>Of course, it wasn’t sustainable (my poor pillow), but it planted a seed.</p>

            <h2>The Real Hair Journey</h2>
<p>In Australia, strangers would ask where I was from and then compliment my hair. At first, it startled me. Other than my boyfriend, no one had ever praised my curls before.</p>
  <p>That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole of research. I stumbled across videos on curly hair care — things like the Curly Girl Method. I experimented, learning about hydration, curl patterns, protein-moisture balance. For my birthday, my boyfriend gifted me a hair diffuser — a simple tool that felt like freedom.</p>
              <p>Piece by piece, I built a routine that worked for me. And somewhere along the way, I stopped trying to “tame” my hair and started honouring it.</p>
<p>One of the very first people I shared this discovery with was my mum. I longed for her to see her own beauty the way I was beginning to see mine. I wanted her to feel the liberation I felt when I stopped fighting my reflection. I sent her products, tutorials, everything I thought might help her reconnect with her curls. But years of conditioning had left their mark, and she chose keratin treatments instead.</p>

            <h2>Today: My Curls, My Confidence</h2>
            <p>I no longer see my curls as something to battle. They are part of me - a symbol of everything I’ve reclaimed.</p>
            <p>They’ve taught me that beauty isn’t about fitting into someone else’s mould; it’s about living in your own, fully and unapologetically.</p>

          <h2>A Message to You</h2>
          <p>If you’ve ever wished your curls away…</p>
          <p>If you’ve ever been told they made you unprofessional, unruly, or unlovable…</p>
          <p>If you’ve stared at your reflection wishing for someone else’s hair - I see you.</p>
          <p>I carry the ache of watching my own mother turn away from the beauty that was always hers. Years of conditioning told her her curls were something to hide, something to fix — and now, it feels too late for her to ever truly know the freedom her natural self could hold.</p>
          <p>But that is why this has become my mission. Because for you, it might not be too late. For the younger version of me, and for every girl who has ever felt “too much” or “not enough,” I want you to know this:<br>
          Your curls are not a curse — they are a crown. Your natural self is radiant, capable, and more than enough.</p>
          <p>You don’t need to shrink to be loved. You don’t need to trade your truth for acceptance.</p>
          <p>You were never the problem — the standard was.</p>
          <p>Let it go. Let your hair flow. And embrace what has always been yours.</p>
