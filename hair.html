<section class="story-intro">
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    There was a time when I battled my own reflection. I hated my hair so much, I’d try to rip it out of my scalp. 
    I’d brush it aggressively, tug at it until it hurt, and even lie down on the couch during dinner trying to flatten it under my own weight — just so it might stay straight. 
    I even tried Jedi mind tricks, imagining my DNA strands and visualising myself tugging the curls to make them straight, hoping somehow, I could rewire my genetics.<br><br>
    Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.

<div class="story-block">
  <div class="story-text">
    <h2>Where the Story Really Began</h2>
    <p>It wasn’t truly my hair I was fighting — it was the societal conditioning I had absorbed about what was “beautiful” and “acceptable.”</p>
    <p>Some of those messages came from the world around me. Some heartbreakingly, came from within my own home.</p>
    <p>One of my earliest memories is of being told I looked like a Sri Lankan male actor (Vijaya Kumaratunga) — meant as a light-hearted joke, but it stung and left a mark that remains with me to this day. I began to wish for different hair, slowly believing I needed it to be worthy of love.</p>
    <p>Then there were the rushed mornings before school. On difficult days, my hair was combed in frustration, and if it didn’t cooperate, the brush was left dangling from my head for me to “deal with.” Somewhere along the line, I started to believe I was “too hard to look after.”</p>
    <p>Both my parents have curls of their own, yet they struggled to embrace them — and I unknowingly carried their unhealed relationship with their hair. Growing up, I’d watch my mum spend time and money on keratin treatments, learning silently that curly hair was something to be “fixed.” I was told I was too young for those treatments, but I looked forward to the day I could.</p>

  <div class="story-text">
    <h2>The Deep Cuts of Comparison</h2>
    <p>I was the only curly-haired child in my family. My siblings’ combable hair seemed to make them effortlessly fit in, while I felt like the odd one out.</p>
    <p>In Sri Lanka, salons wouldn’t just cut curly hair — they’d automatically blow-dry it straight, as though doing me a favour. My mum would even request stylists to reduce my hair volume, calling it <em>yaksha konde</em> — “devil hair.” My sister’s hair, by contrast, was always admired.</p>
    <p>At special occasions, I’d sit in the salon chair, waiting for the “transformation.” Once my hair was sleek and straight, I finally felt “presentable.” I’d delay washing it, holding onto that version of myself as long as possible. At school, those were my “good hair days” — but deep down, I knew that version of me wasn’t real.</p>
    <p>Even the media mirrored this message: heroines with golden straight locks, villains with unruly curls. From <em>Tangled</em> to <em>The Princess Diaries</em> to <em>Harry Potter</em>, curls were coded as messy, untrustworthy, or in need of fixing. The only time I saw curls celebrated was in <em>Brave</em> — and even then, they belonged to a fair-skinned redhead, never someone who looked like me.</p>
    <p>That absence left an imprint on me… and I know many other curly-haired girls have carried it too.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="story-block">
  <div class="story-text">
    <h2>When Everything Began to Change</h2>
    <p>Then I met my boyfriend.</p>
    <p>One of the first things he ever said to me — long before we started dating — was that he loved my natural curls more than when I straightened them. I thought he was joking. I had never been complimented on my curls before, so I couldn’t believe him.</p>
    <p>Once, while we were talking about movies, he even mentioned that he liked Mother Gothel’s hair in <em>Tangled</em> more than Rapunzel’s. To me, that sounded absurd — she was the villain, and her curls were part of the “messy and untrustworthy” image I had been conditioned to dislike. I was so deeply wired to see straight hair as beautiful that I assumed he was being sarcastic.</p>
    <p>And truthfully… I didn’t believe him. Not for years. But over time, his love for the things I tried to hide began to rub off on me. Everything I was insecure about… he celebrated. He helped me see that what I thought made me less, made me me.</p>

    <h2>A Wet Pillow and a Turning Point</h2>
    <p>One night, I went to bed with wet hair and woke up to defined curl clumps. I decided not to brush them out — just once — because they actually looked good. That tiny decision felt like a breakthrough. For a while, I thought I had cracked the code: “Just sleep with wet hair, that’s the trick!”</p>
    <p>Of course, it wasn’t sustainable (sorry, pillow), but it planted a seed.</p>

    <h2>A New Country, A New Chapter</h2>
    <p>That seed took root when I moved to Australia for university. Away from home, away from the voices that mocked and minimised me, I finally had space to create my own identity. For the first time, I wasn’t just someone’s daughter or sister — I was simply me. And I wanted to meet that version of myself.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="story-block">
  <div class="story-text">
    <h2>The Real Hair Journey</h2>
    <p>In Australia, strangers would ask where I was from and then compliment my hair. At first, it shocked me. Apart from my boyfriend, no one had ever praised my curls before.</p>
    <p>Curious, I started researching. That’s when I stumbled across videos about curly hair care — the Curly Girl Method, hydration, protein-moisture balance. I experimented, I learned, I built a routine. For my birthday, my boyfriend gifted me a hair diffuser — a simple tool that felt like freedom.</p>
    <p>Piece by piece, I stopped trying to “tame” my hair and started honouring it.</p>
    <p>One of the very first people I shared my discovery with was my mum. Deep down, I longed for her to see her own beauty the way I was beginning to see mine. I wanted her to feel the freedom I felt when I stopped fighting my hair and began embracing it. I sent her products, tutorials, and everything I thought might help her reconnect with her curls. But years of conditioning had left their mark, and she chose keratin treatments instead.</p>
    <p>It breaks my heart to think she may never know the power and beauty her natural hair holds. But that’s what drives me now. If I can’t change the past, I can help change the future — for girls like me, who once felt lost and unworthy. My mission is to show them that their curls are not a curse, but a crown. That their natural selves are radiant, capable, and more than enough.</p>

    <h2>Today: My Curls, My Confidence</h2>
    <p>I no longer see my curls as something to battle. They are part of me — a symbol of everything I’ve reclaimed.</p>
    <p>They’ve taught me that beauty isn’t about fitting into someone else’s mould; it’s about living in your own, fully and unapologetically.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="highlight no-flip">
  <h2>A Message to You</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever wished your curls away…</p>
  <p>If you’ve been told they made you unprofessional, unruly, or unlovable…</p>
  <p>If you’ve stared at your reflection wishing for someone else’s hair — I see you.</p>
  <p>Your curls don’t need to be straight to be beautiful. You don’t need to shrink to be loved.</p>
  <p>You were never the problem — the standard was.</p>
  <p>Let it go. Let your hair flow. And embrace what has always been yours.</p>
