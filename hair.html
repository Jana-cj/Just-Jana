          There was a time when I battled my own reflection. I hated my hair so much, I’d try to rip it out of my scalp.
          I’d brush it aggressively, tug at it until it hurt, and even lie down on the couch during dinner trying to flatten it under my own weight — just so it might stay straight.
          I even tried Jedi mind tricks, imagining my DNA strands and visualising myself tugging the curls to make them straight, hoping somehow, I could rewire my genetics.
          <br><br> Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.

        <div class="story-block">
          <div class="story-text">
            <h2>Where the Story Really Began</h2>
            <p>It wasn’t truly my hair I was fighting — it was the societal conditioning I’d absorbed about what was “beautiful” and “acceptable.”</p>
            <p>Some of those messages came from the world around me. Some, heartbreakingly, came from within my own home.</p>
            <p>One of my earliest memories are of being told that I look like a Sri Lankan male actor (Vijaya Kumaratunga) — meant as a light-hearted joke, but to me, it stung and left a mark to this day. I began to wish for different hair, slowly believing I needed it to be worthy of love.</p>
            <p>Then there were the mornings before school when I was younger — rushed and chaotic. On difficult days, my hair was combed in frustration and if my hair didn’t cooperate, the brush was left dangling from my head for me to “deal with.” Somewhere along the line, I started to believe I was “too hard to look after.”</p>
            <p>Both my parents have curls of their own, yet they struggle to embrace them — and I unknowingly carried their unhealed relationship with their hair. Growing up, I’d watch my mum spend a lot of time and money on keratin treatments, learning silently that curly hair was something to be “fixed.” I was told I was too young to have those treatments, but I was eagerly looking forward to the day I could.</p>

        <!-- The Deep Cuts of Comparison -->
        <div class="story-block">
          <div class="story-text">
            <h2>The Deep Cuts of Comparison</h2>
            <p>I was the only curly-haired child in my family. My siblings’ combable hair seemed to make them effortlessly fit in, while I felt like the odd one out.</p>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, salons wouldn’t just cut your hair — they’d blow-dry it straight if you have natural curls, as though doing you a favour. My mum would specifically request stylists to reduce my hair volume, using phrases like she has <em>yaksha konde</em> — “devil hair.” My sister’s hair, on the other hand, was always admired.</p>
            <p>At special occasions, I’d sit in a salon chair, waiting for the magical transformation. Once my hair was sleek and straight, I felt “presentable.” I’d delay washing it, holding onto that version of myself for as long as possible. At school, those days were met with “Wow! Good hair day!” — and although I smiled, it hurt to know that version of me wasn’t my true self.</p>
            <p>Even the media seemed to whisper the same message — sometimes loudly, sometimes so subtly you almost missed it. In Sri Lanka, shampoo ads would feature white women with pin-straight hair, women who looked nothing like anyone I knew. On screen, the “beautiful” heroines so often shared the same template — in <em>Tangled</em>, the radiant main character had long, straight blonde hair, while the villain was given dark, curly locks.</p>
            <p>It didn’t stop there. <em>The Princess Diaries</em> made the “before” version of a girl — wild curls and all — seem like a problem to be fixed. In <em>Harry Potter</em>, Bellatrix Lestrange’s chaotic curls were used as a visual cue for madness. Over and over again, curls became shorthand for “messy,” “unruly,” “untrustworthy.”</p>
            <p>The only time I can remember curls being shown as something beautiful was in <em>Brave</em> (2012) — and even then, they belonged to a fair-skinned, red-haired character. Never dark skin. Never dark hair. Never someone who looked like me, or like so many other South Asian girls.</p>
            <p>I can count on one hand the times I saw curls celebrated — not as a punchline, not as a villain’s mark, but as something powerful, heroic, and worthy. That absence left an imprint on me… and I know it’s one many other curly-haired girls have carried too.</p>

            <h2>When Everything Began to Change</h2>
            <p>Then I met my boyfriend.</p>
            <p>One of the very first things he ever said to me — long before we started dating — was that he loved my natural hair and preferred it over when I straightened it. I honestly thought he was joking. I’d never been complimented on my curls before, so I couldn’t believe him.</p>
            <p>Once, while we were talking about movies, he even mentioned that he actually liked Mother Gothel’s hair in <em>Tangled</em> more than Rapunzel’s. To me, that sounded absurd — she was the villain, and her curls were part of the “messy and untrustworthy” image I had been conditioned to dislike. I was so deeply wired to see straight hair as beautiful that I assumed he was being sarcastic.</p>
            <p>And truthfully… I didn’t believe him. Not for years. But over time, his love for the things I tried to hide started rubbing off on me. Everything I was insecure about… he celebrated. He helped me see that what I thought made me less, made me me.</p>

            <h2>A Wet Pillow and a Turning Point</h2>
            <p>One night, I went to bed with wet hair and woke up to defined curl clumps. I decided not to brush them out — just for once — because I felt like they looked good. That tiny decision felt like a breakthrough. For a while, I thought I was a genius: “Just sleep with wet hair, that’s the trick!”</p>
            <p>Of course, it wasn’t sustainable (my poor pillow), but it planted a seed.</p>

            <p>That seed took root when I moved to Australia for university. Away from home, away from the voices that mocked and minimised me, I finally had space to create my own identity. For the first time, I wasn’t just someone’s sister — I was simply me. And I wanted to meet that version of myself.</p>

        <!-- The Real Hair Journey -->
        <div class="story-block">
          <div class="story-text">
            <h2>The Real Hair Journey</h2>
            <p>In Australia, strangers would ask where I was from and then compliment my hair. At first, it shocked me. Other than my boyfriend, no one had ever praised my curls before. Curious, I started researching. That’s when I stumbled across videos about curly hair care — things like the Curly Girl Method. I experimented. I learned about hydration, curl patterns, protein-moisture balance. For my birthday, my boyfriend gifted me a hair diffuser — a simple tool that felt like freedom.</p>
            <p>Piece by piece, I built a routine that worked for me. And somewhere along the way, I stopped trying to “tame” my hair and started honouring it.</p>
            <p>One of the very first people I shared my discovery with was my mum. Deep down, I longed for her to see her own beauty the way I was beginning to see mine. I wanted her to feel the freedom I felt when I finally stopped fighting my hair and started embracing it. I sent her products, tutorials, and everything I thought might help her reconnect with her curls. But years of conditioning had left their mark, and she chose keratin treatments instead.</p>
            <p>It breaks my heart to think she may never know the power and beauty her natural hair holds. But that’s what drives me now. If I can’t change the past, I can help change the future — for girls like me, who once felt lost and unworthy. My mission is to show them that their curls are not a curse, but a crown. That their natural selves are radiant, capable, and more than enough.</p>

          <h2>A Message to You</h2>
          <p>If you’ve ever wished your curls away…</p>
          <p>If you’ve ever been told they made you unprofessional, unruly, or unlovable…</p>
          <p>If you’ve stared at your reflection wishing for someone else’s hair — I see you.</p>
          <p>Your curls don’t need to be straight to be beautiful. You don’t need to shrink to be loved.</p>
          <p>You were never the problem — the standard was.</p>
          <p>Let it go. Let your hair flow. And embrace what has always been yours.</p>
