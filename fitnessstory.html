        <h2>Fragile Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I wasn’t a strong kid - in fact, I was extremely skinny. Not by choice, but because most foods didn’t sit well with me. I had a weak appetite and poor digestion, and many meals left me feeling worse instead of nourished. It was simply my body’s response to unknown allergies, stressful and anxiety-inducing environments, and circumstances beyond my control that I couldn’t understand at the time.<br><br>But one thing brought me to life: netball.</p>

        <h2>Discovering Netball - My First Safe Space</h2>
        <p>When I joined the school netball team at eight years old, it was the first place I wasn’t compared to my sister. The court became my escape - the only part of school I actually looked forward to. I tried other sports, but nothing made me feel more me than netball. It was my spark, my safe space.</p>
        <p>Still, like in many South Asian homes, sports weren’t considered important - especially not for girls. Academics always came first. Strength, fitness, athleticism… none of it was ever nurtured, and often dismissed entirely.</p>

        <h2>Success Met with Doubt</h2>
        <p>I was chosen as netball captain. I rushed home, proud—only to be met with doubt. My mum worried it looked like nepotism and called the coach to remove me. Thankfully, the coach stood firm. But that moment planted the seed of imposter syndrome.</p>
        <p>A few years later, I was named Best Shooter. My name was in the newspaper. Yet, the librarian assumed it was my sister. I was invisible again.</p>
        <p>When I expressed interest in athletics, I was mocked. But I was later appointed Athletics Captain. Even then, my name was removed from a relay last minute, without a word. I learned how easy it is to be left out, and how powerful silence can be. </p>
        <p>Compliments were always diluted. My success was labeled “luck.” Even at swimming, people assumed I couldn’t perform — until I won.</p>

        <h2>Lessons in Resilience</h2>
        <p>Looking back, I see these weren’t personal attacks — they were reflections of others’ insecurities. I learned: you can’t control what people say, but you can control whether you believe them.</p>
        <p>People will try to downplay your wins, especially when they see something in you that they haven’t yet found in themselves. But their opinion is not your reality.</p>

        <h2>A New Chapter in Australia</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a home where I felt I had to shrink myself. But when I moved to Australia in 2019, everything changed. For the first time, I was free to explore who I was, outside of comparison. I entered a gym — something I never thought I’d do. My partner gently guided me, challenged the beliefs I’d grown up with. At 43kg, I chose strength. Not to look a certain way, but to feel powerful.</p>

        <h2>Falling in Love with Movement</h2>
        <p>As I trained and nourished myself, I built muscle — and more importantly, self-respect. During COVID, training became routine. Movement gave me structure, clarity, and peace. In 2021, I joined my university’s netball team and later ran my first 10km run.</p>

        <h2>The Injury That Changed Everything</h2>
        <p>In 2022, during a netball final, I sprinted — and my femur snapped. A freak accident. My bone density was excellent. The fall was just too much. Rehabilitation was long and painful. I had to relearn how to walk. But I gained something far deeper: the realization that movement is a privilege. I would never take it for granted again.</p>

        <h2>Rising Stronger</h2>
        <p>As my legs healed, I shifted focus to upper body training — pull-ups, dips, push-ups, calisthenics. I found strength in ways I’d never known. Eventually, I completed a 5km run. I trained smarter, focused on recovery, mobility, and sustainability. I didn’t just regain strength — I rebuilt my mindset.</p>

        <h2>Why I Created This Space</h2>
        <p>As a South Asian woman, I know how rare it is to be encouraged to be strong. Fitness is often seen as masculine or unnecessary. But strength lives in all of us — in the boundaries we set, the healing we do, the discipline we hold.</p>
        <p>This space is for those who were told to stay small. Who were overlooked, dismissed, or expected to serve before dreaming. It’s a space to reclaim your power and move for healing, not just aesthetics.</p>

        <h2>My Message to You</h2>
        <p>If you’ve ever doubted your worth, felt you had to prove yourself through perfection — please know: you are enough, just as you are. Your value isn’t tied to appearance or achievement. All that matters is showing up for yourself, again and again. Movement saved me. It transformed me. And I believe it can do the same for you.<br><br>I’m here to walk beside you, every step of the way. ♡</p>
