        <h2>Fragile Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I wasn’t a strong kid - in fact, I was extremely skinny. <br> Not by choice, but because most foods didn’t sit well with me. I had a weak appetite and poor digestion, and many meals left me feeling worse instead of nourished. <br> It was simply my body’s response to unknown allergies, stressful and anxiety-inducing environments, and circumstances beyond my control that I couldn’t understand at the time. <br><br>But one thing brought me to life: <b>netball.</b></p>

        <h2>Discovering Netball - My First Safe Space</h2>
        <p>When I joined the school netball team at eight years old, it was the first place I wasn’t compared to my sister. The court became my escape - the only part of school I actually looked forward to. I tried other sports, but nothing made me feel more me than netball. <br> It was my spark, my safe space.</p>
        <p>Still, like in many South Asian homes, sports weren’t considered important - especially not for girls. Academics always came first. Strength, fitness, athleticism… none of it was ever nurtured, and often dismissed entirely.</p>

        <h2>Success Met with Doubt</h2>
        <p>One day, something unexpected happened: our school announced the first-ever netball captains, and both my sister and I were chosen for our age groups. <br> I was so proud of myself - I even finished all my food during the school break, which was rare for me. </p>
        <p>When I shared the news at home, the response wasn’t what I expected. <br> Concerns were raised about how other parents might perceive the decision, and a call was made to the coach to reconsider my captaincy. <br> My coach, however, reassured that it was a team decision and that they truly believed I had earned the role. <br> I remember sitting there, confused - unsure how something so exciting had suddenly become complicated. <br> That was the first time I felt a flicker of imposter syndrome. I knew I had worked hard for it, yet part of me began to wonder if I really belonged.</p>
        <p>A few years later, I was named Best Shooter for our age group, and my name appeared in the local newspaper. <br> At the school library, I was handed the paper and told it featured my sister - <br> a small moment that reminded me how easy it was for my own achievements to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>Over time, I found myself drawn to athletics. I wanted to try middle-distance races and see what my body could do. <br> On one occasion, while browsing sports equipment for training, my request for ankle weights was met with ridicule and hesitation. I walked away feeling as though my interest in something new wasn’t being taken seriously. <br> But not long after, I was appointed School Athletics Captain.</p>
        <p>Even with these milestones, moments of doubt from others still appeared. <br> At our final school sports meet, I turned up for a relay I had trained for, only to discover my name had been replaced on the team list. It was the only event I had that day. <br> The sting was sharper than I could have imagined - not just from being left out, but from the silence of people I thought were my friends. <br> Having my partner and another friend there for support meant everything. In that moment, I learned a very valuable lesson about friendship and about how easily people can misjudge your potential when they haven’t truly seen you.</p>
        <p>In another mixed netball–basketball event, I played shooter and most of my shots landed. A compliment from a basketball player from the opposing team was quickly brushed off by someone who has played no sports as “kana shots” (lucky shots). <br> I began noticing a pattern - no matter how well I performed, there always seemed to be a reason to downplay it.</p>
        <p>At an interhouse swimming meet, I overheard someone doubting whether I could even swim. That same day, I won multiple events - a quiet reminder to myself that others’ assumptions don’t define my abilities.</p>

        <h2>Lessons in Resilience</h2>
        <p>These are just a few examples of the many comments I've received growing up that were meant to discourage me - and I’m sure many of us face moments like this, because criticism is unfortunately an inevitable part of life. <br> Looking back, I’ve come to see these moments for what they were. Not personal attacks - but reflections of other people’s insecurities. These experiences taught me a valuable lesson: <br>
You can’t control what people say, but you can control whether or not you believe it.</p>
        <p>People will try to downplay your wins, especially when they see something in you that they haven’t yet found in themselves. <br>But their opinion is not your reality.</p>

        <h2>A New Chapter in Australia</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a home where I constantly felt like I had to shrink myself - emotionally, mentally, and physically. I walked on eggshells for most of my childhood. I was just counting the days until I could leave.</p>
        <p>When I moved to Australia in 2019, my life shifted. 
I got to finally explore who I am rather than simply following my sisters footsteps. I stepped into a gym for the first time - something I never imagined I’d do. Growing up, I believed the gym was for guys. That’s what I was conditioned to believe. Girls weren’t supposed to lift weights or build muscle.</p>
<p>But my partner gently challenged those beliefs. He was patient. Supportive. He taught me the basics and gave me the confidence to begin. I weighed just 43kg at the time, and for the first time in my life, I wanted to get stronger - not to look a certain way, but to feel powerful in my body.</p>

        <h2>Falling in Love with Movement</h2>
        <p>As I changed how I ate and trained, I started to gain healthy weight. I built muscle. And for the first time ever, I saw my body as something to care for, not criticize.</p>
        <p>When COVID hit in 2020, gym training became a regular part of our lives. I began to fall in love with movement - not just for the physical benefits, but for what it did for my mind. It gave me structure, strength, clarity, and peace.</p>
        <p>In 2021, I joined my university’s indoor netball team and later represented them at intervarsity netball games. I also ran my first 10km run - something I never thought I’d be capable of.</p>
        <p>But life had one more curveball in store.</p>

        <h2>The Setback That Changed Everything</h2>
        <p>During our 2022 netball finals, we were leading by a huge margin. I sprinted to defend the ball when I slipped on the turf. My ankle twisted. My knee hyperextended. And then - I heard it. My femur snapped.</p>
        <p>The pain was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Later scans confirmed it was a freak accident - turns out my bone density was well above average sitting at 1.3 g/cm², but the force of the fall was just too much.</p>
        <p>Rehabilitation was slow and humbling. I had to relearn how to walk. I couldn’t move the way I used to. But that experience taught me something I hadn’t fully grasped before: <br><b> Movement is a privilege.</b></p>
        <p>And I would never take it for granted again.</p>

        <h2>Bouncing Back Stronger</h2>
        <p>Since I was forced to take it easy with my lower body training. I took it as an opportunity to focus more on my upper body. That’s when I discovered calisthenics and really got into pull-ups, dips, and eventually weighted dips, push-ups, and even clap push-ups. Watching my partner do effortless weighted pull-ups and muscle-ups sparked my curiosity and motivation to train harder. </p>
        <p>Over time, my legs healed fully, and the following year, I managed to complete a 5km run. I trained more intentionally than ever. I focused on mobility, recovery, and long-term health. My legs became stronger. So did my mindset.</p>

        <h2 class="fitnesswhy">Why This Journey Matters To Me </h2><br>
        <p>As a South Asian woman, I know how rare it is to be encouraged to be strong. We’re taught to shrink ourselves from the day we were born - to be quiet, gentle, small. Fitness is still seen by many as something masculine, inappropriate, or unnecessary for girls.</p>
        <p>But strength isn’t about gender. It’s a quality that lives within every human being. It’s not just in the muscles - it’s in the choices we make, the wounds we heal, and the respect we hold for ourselves.</p>
        <p>That’s why I created this space.</p>
        <p>A safe space for girls who have been overlooked, dismissed, or told they aren’t enough. Girls who were expected to serve before dreaming. Girls whose paths have been blurred by comparison.</p>
        <p>This is a place to reclaim your power. To nourish your body, mind, and soul. To move not just for change on the outside, but for healing from within.</p>
        <p>This journey isn’t about perfection or fitting into anyone else’s mold. It’s about embracing who you are - whole, powerful, and deserving. Building a life and body that reflect your truth, not someone else’s expectations.</p>
<br>
       <h2 class="fitnessmsg">From My Heart to Yours </h2>
        <p>If you’ve ever doubted your place, felt not good enough, or believed you had to prove your value through perfection, I want you to hear this:</p>
        <p>You are enough - right now, just as you are. Your worth is not measured by others’ opinions or your achievements.</p>
        <p>All that matters is showing up for yourself, every day, and choosing progress over perfection.</p>
        <p>Movement saved me. It transformed me. And I believe it can do the same for you.</p>
        <p>I’m here to walk beside you, every step of the way!</p>
        <p>With you, always - Jana ♡</p>
